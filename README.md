# butlerbot
A slack/discord bot which logs user activity among other butler tasks.

_butlerbot_ is intended to log tasks and create time sheets for users and group projects automatically each day, as well as basic bot commands. Inspired by a few slackbots, including NikaBot. The Slack version uses BotKit and the discord version uses discord.js.

## Integration
This butlerbot is not yet available for public use, as he is still being trained to be the best butler for your household. Note, if you play with this, you will notice there are unused dependencies. This is because a prior version of butlerbot used them and will be removed as the more complete version of butlerbot is made.
